# Gridworld-Reinforcement-Learning

This repository contains code for creating two 2d gridworld environments and implementing a Reinforcement Learning algorithm (Q-learning) for the agent to learn about the environment and eventually learn its way to navigate towards the goal state.

The description of each file is given below:

1. 'gridworld_large.py' contains the code for the large grid world environment (40 x 40). Running this file will enable the user to play the game in keyboard mode.

2. 'gridworld_small.py' contains the code for the small grid world environment (20 x 20). Running this file will enable the user to play the game in keyboard mode.


3. 'learner_large.py' contains the code for the RL agent as well as the Random Agent for the smaller (40x40) environment.

4. 'learner_small.py' contains the code for the RL agent as well as the Random Agent for the smaller (20x20) environment.
